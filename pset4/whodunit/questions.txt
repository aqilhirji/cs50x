1.  A header file in the C standard library that provides a set of typedefs with specifiec width requirments. Also provides macros to specify limits, and functions to create the specified value types. 
2.  You can limit the space in a file to exactly what's necessary for the type. This allows efficiency of space in files. 
3.  BYTE - 1, DWORD - 4 bytes, LONG - 4 bytes, WORD - 2 bytes
4.  HEX - 0x42 0x4d, ACII - BM
5.  bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file, where biSize is the total number of bytes in the header file. 
6.  biHeight is negative when the pixels in the data file are ordered from top to bottom. 
7.  biBitCount
8.  fopen may return null when it either can't find the file to open, or fails to open due to file size, permissions, etc. 
9.  The third argument always defines the maximum number of files we'd like to read, which is always 1 in our case. 
10. Padding gets a value of 3: sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) = 3, 3*3 = 9 modulo 4 = 1,  4 - 1 = 3, 3 modulo 4 = 3  
11. fseek allows the accessing of a specific position in a file. 
12. SEEK_CURR - is an integer argument to fseek or fseeki64 which specifies the position in a file relative to the current position.
